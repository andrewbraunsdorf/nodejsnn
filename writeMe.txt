Clients and Servers
Ask for data from website
Request from the client to the server
Response from the server to the client

Protocol- A set of communication rules, that two sides agree to use when communicating.
Each computer or server can be identified by its own unique IP address.
If the client wants to make a request to the server it first needs to connect to the IP address which will open a socket that allows info to be sent.  Info to be sent is structured in different protocols, ex http or ftp, protocols are what they relate to.
File Transfer Protocol
Structure has been decided on, is sent down a socket and packet is 
Sent from server to the client is via a protocol called TCP.
TCP splits information into smaller packets and transfer them around the socket.
Nodejs allows us to access this information.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a networking protocol that provides reliable, ordered and error-checked delivery of a stream of data between applications. A TCP 
server can accept a TCP connection request, and once the connection is established both sides can exchange data streams.

Ports: a program running on a computer can listen for requests sent to a particular port number
How do we know node.js should deal with the request and not the email address.
All have a port #, so only if it listening on the port number it will listen for this request.
Node.js might be listening to a particular port.
