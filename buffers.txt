Buffers
Temporary storage spot for a chunk of data that is being transferred from one place to another
The buffer is filled with data, then passed along
Transfer small chunks of data at a time

All data in one big pile...then instead of waiting it to be stored in memory, stored in a temporary buffer. Data is then passed on and able to be processed
Stream: we have a data source, with a small chunk of data to be processed 
Just wait for chunks of data to be processed.
Like waiting for a video to load.  We do not have to wait for the entire data to be loaded

Streams in Node.js
Can create streams in Node.js to transfer data
Increase performance
Also true when dealing with requests and waiting for the data to be consumed
